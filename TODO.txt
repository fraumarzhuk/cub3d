Marianna:
//Save textures into img;
//Make ray cast on the map, w/o moving the map around for now.
//Soft movements in minimap

Tobi:
// Fix West Bug (literally impossible :/)
// Change negativ-evaluation for up and down
// Spread out initial Window? (definetly doable on WE)
// Get something for neck pain...
